  <h2>Workshop Abstract</h2>
<p>Organizations that are serious about DevOPS know that they need to integrate the management of their environments within Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines. Office365DSC makes it possible for organizations to extract the configuration of their existing tenants workloads (SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Teams, etc.) and eases the process of integrating Office 365 configuration management with Azure DevOPS. Need to make a configuration change to your SharePoint Online Search configurations? Simply update your configuration within Azure DevOPS and let your CI/CD pipelines handle the rest. In this session we will do an end-to-end demo of how organizations can take an existing Office 365 tenants and integrate it with Azure DevOPS Pipelines.</p>
