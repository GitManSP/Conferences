  <h2>Session Abstract</h2>
<p>Azure DevOps makes it easier than ever for SharePoint administrators to manage their environments using Configuration-as-code. Using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, and PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), we can now fully automate the creation of a complete SharePoint farm from the ground up. Organizations that manage their environments' configuration in code can leverage Azure DevOps Pipeline to automatically publish configuration changes to multiple environments. In this session we will provide the audience with an introduction of how Azure DevOps server can help their organizations manage their Continous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines to automate the deployment, configuration, and monitoring of their SharePoint 2019 environments in Azure.</p>
